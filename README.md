Yet another markdown editor project.

So why?

I like taking notes when I work, read, play games, doing whatever. I like writing things down and organizing those notes.

So it felt like a good excuse to try some different tech. I started looking at Electron as I'm already familiar with JS. And realized that both Notion and obsidian are written using Electron. And Electron is a part of their 'large' use of memory. Something I dislike.

So this is my attempt to make a similar ish notetaking app that uses less than 400mb of memory at a idle state with a single page open. Using Tauri.
